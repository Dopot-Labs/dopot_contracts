///
/// We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead of returning
/// `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with
/// the with the expectations of Erc20 applications.
///
/// Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows
/// applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said
/// events. Other implementations of the Erc may not emit these events, as it isn't
/// required by the specification.
///
/// Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been
/// added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.
